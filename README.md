Status of MS: In Prep

Authors: Matthew D. Green, David B. Herbst, and Kurt E. Anderson

# Structure of Code

1) Stream.Analysis.R  stream analysis
2) Plotting.R makes all figures used in the manuscript 
3) Stream.Analysis.R Lake anlyses and organize code

# Data

1) Data Availability: Zooplankton data (Knapp et al. 2020) used in this study can be accessed from Environmental Data Initiative at https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?scope=edi&identifier=577&revision=2. 

2) Macroinvertebrate data (Green et al. 2022) can be accessed from Dryad at https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.2fqz612qw.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32375195/168113156-d67ea2e6-2fad-45a3-b55e-616297291ada.png)


# Results

### Fig 1: Individual zooplankton (a) and macroinvertebrate (b) species responses to fish presence. Only species that occur in both fish and fishless sites are included in this figure. The order of each x-axis is based on average body size, from smallest to largest species.
